<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hey there! I'm Hemakshi, and welcome to my little corner of the internet!
<br/>
I’m a Computer Science student, passionate about learning new things, devloping new skills and find creative ways to problem solving or expressing myself . For as long as I can remember, I’ve been captivated by how websites and applications are created and designed , and that curiosity led me to where I am today, in being a CS student and learning about web devlopment. My work represents the things I've learnt or am learning in my journey.
